# Forest-Classifier
The goal of this program is to develop a predictive model that can determine, given 54 cartographic variables, the correct forest type. There are 7 forest types (1-7) in the dataset. Each observation (record) represents a 30x30 meter region. As such, the goal is to develop the best classification model that can predict the forest type given the observation.
The classifier used in this project was a Decision Tree classifier
